1. Box-Jenkins Models
(1) Visualise the data;

(2) Find the ACF and PACF; Propose several models based on analysis of ACF and PACF.

(3) Choose the model that is the most accurate, robust, and the simplest.

(4) Test the assumptions

(5) Provide recommendations to Mr. DeCoria.


2. Time series regression models
(1) Visualise the data;

(2) Create a new temperature variable; Plot two scatterplots: 1. the regular temperature vs. calls volume; 2. the new temperature variable vs. calls volume. Comment on the patterns.

(3) Study the cross-correlations between the unemployment rate and the calls volume.

(4)	Create a lagged unemployment rate variable and relate it to emergency road service based on your ccf analysis. Fit the model using lagged unemployment as a predictor.

(5)	Develop a multiple regression equation using the new transformed average temperature variable created in and the lagged unemployment variable created earlier that describe the calls volume the best.

(6)	Prepare a memo
